# Computing and Security Technology
The College of Computing & Informatics' Bachelor of Science in Computing and Security Technology (BSCST) prepares students for work related to securing and managing large-scale computing infrastructure. Students gain experience with core information technology (IT) areas including servers, databases, networks, the Web, virtualization, cloud computing, information security, and cybersecurity technologies. The program emphasizes practical education and fundamental concepts that are supplemented by laboratory experience.

Core courses provide students with practical knowledge and skills related to managing servers, network administration, database administration, cloud computing and cybersecurity fundamentals. Students take advanced electives and a concentration in either Computing Technology or Computing Security. The advanced courses include topics such as mobile applications, wireless networks, risk assessment, intrusion detection, security audits, computer forensics, ethical hacking, cloud security, disaster recovery, and continuity of business.

CCI's bachelor degree programs in Computing and Security Technology, Data Science, and Information Systems share a common first year. This allows students to easily switch among the degrees early in their studies. In addition, some of the electives in each degree are accessible to students in the other two majors; this provides a deeper and broader set of advanced topics for students in all three majors.

The BS in Computing and Security Technology is offered as a full-time, on-campus bachelor's degree program or as an online, part-time degree completion program for students who have completed approximately two years of college work.
