# Information Systems
The College of Computing & Informatics' Bachelor of Science in Information Systems (BSIS) prepares students to apply information technology for the benefit of individuals and organizations. Students develop the skills and knowledge to design, develop, and manage leading-edge information systems. Since many Information Systems students choose careers in business organizations, a minor in business is built into the degree requirements.

The Information Systems curriculum prepares students for a wide range of information technology applications. Students learn how to determine client needs, design appropriate solutions, specify data architectures, and improve the usability of systems.

The core courses in the program address topics including fundamentals of programming, systems analysis and design, database management systems, networking, security and privacy, and social aspects of information systems. These courses provide a foundation for more advanced courses in technical areas of interest to each student. The technical courses are supplemented by courses in business, behavioral sciences, natural sciences, mathematics, and the humanities to provide balance and useful supplemental materials for information systems careers.
