# Software Engineering
The College of Computing & Informatics' Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering (BSSE) prepares students to design and build software systems. Software is essential to the functioning of modern society but high-quality software is very challenging to create. Software engineering focuses on the knowledge and skills to meet that challenge and create high quality software on schedule within budget. 

The Software Engineering curriculum addresses a full range of software activities including gathering client requirements, designing and constructing software solutions, testing software, and modifying and extending existing systems. The curriculum also recognizes that most software is developed by teams, and students develop skills in project management and team operation. This hands-on curriculum combined with co-op provides real-world experience that culminates in a full-year software team capstone project involving in-depth study and application of computing and informatics. Graduates are well-prepared to function as software engineering team members and also move toward software engineering management. 

The core courses address programming and use of software development tools, specification and design, software architecture, verification and validation, software evolution, and team projects. These courses are supplemented with courses drawn from Computer Science and Informatics that provide theoretical background and application knowledge. The full curriculum prepares BSSE students to apply processes, methods, and tools to the problem of building and maintaining software with a defined level of quality, at a predictable cost, on a predictable schedule.
